#Release Scope Change by Iteration

## Description

This is based on the standard Release Scope Change report. It has been updated to essentially pivot the data from the original and show a unique list of user stories/defects (backlog items), mapped onto the iterations that fall into the release.

## Todo

- Map changes made to a backlog item into the correct periods
- Show relevant information with the period (estimate changes, added, removed etc.)
- Add a column for defect statistics
- Add a column for test case statistics
