#Release Scope Change by Iteration

## Description

This is based on the standard Release Scope Change report. It has been updated to essentially pivot the data from the original and show a unique list of user stories/defects (backlog items), mapped onto the iterations that fall into the release.

## Features

- Unique story / defect list.
- Displays start/final/delta in story points for each item
- Shows changes (Added, Removed, Resized) per iteration for each item.
- Only shows iterations that fall completely within the release start/end.
- Deals with out of range dates or modified release end points with a pre-release and post-release column.
- Extra details on hover/click within iterations.
