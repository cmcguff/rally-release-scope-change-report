#Release Scope Change by Iteration

## Description

This is based on the standard Release Scope Change report. It has been updated to essentially pivot the data from the original and show a unique list of user stories/defects (backlog items), mapped onto the iterations that fall into the release.

## Todo

- Add a column for defect statistics
- Add a column for test case statistics
- remove delta column
- add a final size column
